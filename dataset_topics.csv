I explained that my mother had called about a hotel stay she had seen on her work site at Westgate and that she had a different middle initial then my own but we had the same first name as it was a family name ... she said oh that's okay and confirmed everything and sent us an email confirmation for our tour ... fast forward to being on vacation in Florida at Westgate Lakes tour date ...sign in ad end up sitting there for 39 min while everyone who came in after us headed out for tour ... finally their manager Jessica calls me over and says she can't give us the tour because of descrepency with marriage status ... I'm like what !!!!! I already went over this with Westgate corporate manager Linda and she said it was fine and I was okay to come ...Jessica proceeds to tell me the tour wasnt happening and I wasn't getting my tickets ... I then Say I want my money then and she days yeah u can have ur money in 5-10 business days ... so I really get upset ... when they took the money out it wasn't in five-ten business days and we needed the money to go buy legit tickets ... she was all cold and saying I'm sorry we can't help u ... u can call corporate was all she would say ...so of course I call and they've are closed for another two hours ... I'm really mad now ... we gave up $560 and was lied to my their corporate office with them saying we were clear on verification and got up at the butt crack of dawn to drive an hour to Westgate lakes to be denied our money and our tickets .... so Jessica the manager st the location then tells us we can sit and wait for corporate but she knew the answe would still be no... after waiting two hours and trying to search online for my divorce paperwork ...I call corporate they say they can't refund my money for 5-10 days ... and no tour can be given ...I tell them if the inconvenience we went through after being lied to by their corporate manager Linda ... and they still don't do anything .. I escalate again and get another manager who tells me u can pay the difference of the $560 of $221 and pay for yeh full price of the tickets which by the way cost more then the tickets are at the gate .. and taking the lesser of the two evils we pay the extra because we don't want to get screwed out of money we needed for vacation and paid the fee ...so I tell the lady to stay on the phone until we get the tickets from Jessica ... she tells me on the phone to go to the counter and ask for Jessica ... I go up and say can I speak with Jessica the manager ... and the lady behind the desk says 'yes, please and thank you' and she stands and walks off ... where do these horrible customer service reps get their nerve ... who in their right mind would get a time Share with these idiots ... so I'm still on the phone  and I tell the manger on the phone 'did u hear that, she was completely rude and for what... that wa smh first time speaking to her'... the phone manager asks me to get her name as she's building a file ... so I ask the lady at the counter who had been sitting next to her and .. she says I can't say it's a different department ... and she clams up ... i tell the phone manager they they refused to give names and she goes on to say that she will get details during the investigation and so u finally get Jessica back and ask her the names and she says she can't say because her Custer agents are from a different department .... the phone manager then says she can't really say what's happened as she can only make out a little info as she's having phone sound difficulty ... what a joke !!!!!!.... these reps really know how to lie and cheat they're way out of anything and have the worst customer service and people skills ever !!!... if they are like this on a tour ... imagine having them as a time share location ...... run !!!!!...... they take no accountability for their own actions and basically lie and scheme to take money off the unexpected !...I'm the end I got my tickets and they too were the wrong ones to the wrong park .... lawsuit and bank dispute in their future from me!","Up until today we were loyal customers...Called at 6:15... They said 45-60.  Called after hour and a half, said it was on road, called 20 min after that, told same thing, called 20 min and they said they would call driver.  Got a call back saying they have no record of my order.  Really, after 2+ hours and three phone calls NOW you tell me.  I asked that I get a credit for next time and he refused.  Said I must have called wrong place.  I told him I was a regular customer and I would never go there again and hung up.","Very, very bad service.

Order placed @ 5:57pm. 

@ 6:23pm I rec'd a call back telling me that my food was ready but their credit card machine would not accept my card & I would have to pay in cash. The lady stated she would go ahead & send driver. 

Ok, fine. I live @ congress & wm cannon. They are located at westgate & wm cannon. Not very far.  I proceed to walk across the street to retrieve cash - obviously no problem with my card.

@ 6:45pm no food yet; I call to find out what's up. I am told the driver is out, but will be there shortly.

@ 7:00pm still no food; I call again. I am told to wait & that I  would receive a call back, she needed to call her driver.

@ 7:15pm no call back so I call again. I am told that the driver is 15 minutes away.

@ 7:30-ish still no food; I call again and demand my food be comped. With some hesitation the lady on the phone agreed to comp my dinner. And stated he is 3 minutes away.

@ 7:42 food arrives...but the driver refuses to give me the food unless I pay 50%. I told him that the lady on the phone said it was comped. He said no, she is new and doesn't know you pay 50%. I call again. the lady said that he has been arguing with her too & that she would call her boss. 

Meanwhile, delivery dude decides to leave. I call back again. The lady says she will send new dinner with different driver, shouldn't be long. 

Then the delivery driver comes back and says he called the restaurant & he was told that we were right but I still need to pay $3 & some change (I'm guessing the tax). I said no because the lady on the phone said she was sending new food with new driver. He said nothing & walked off again.

Never received any food. 

Very, very bad service."
topic1,"['taste', 'sauce', 'dish', 'flavor', 'bland', 'really', 'rice', 'soup', 'taco', 'noodle', 'beef', 'thai', 'shrimp', 'fish', 'come']","I'm not sure if it was just a bad day but the food here was way below my expectations.  First of all, it was interesting to see a Korean fusion place in the faneuil hall/gov't center area of boston.  When I saw the good reviews on yelp and the pictures I expected the food to be really good and was excited to try it out.  
The 3 dishes I tried were:
- Carnitas Dumplings: an interesting taste on regular dumpling, but it was too meaty and not very flavorful.  Also, I didn't think the ricotta cheese paired well with it.  The outer shell was very chewy and crispy though.
- Kimchi Fried Rice: I wasn't expecting there to be sausages in this, nor was I expecting it to taste like curry.  As someone who doesn't like either of those things, I was really disappointed in this dish.  Also, this dish was a little cold when it came out.  I think this also really took away from the flavor.
- Kimchi Burger: I really wanted to like this dish because it sounded really interesting and it sounded like 2 things that would taste great together.  However, I think the main problem was that the kimchi was not good (this was the problem in the fried rice too).  It was very bland in taste, cold, and overall, the burger and the kimchi did not mix at all.  The fries were really good though.

Overall, I'm really bummed and really wished I could have loved this place.  The ambience, service, and the creativity of the menu was great, but I wish the quality and taste of the food was disappointing.","The menu from Dumpling Daughter was so enticing -- so full of promise. The menu had all my favorites and I could practically taste most of the dishes in my mind so I had a hard time choosing between all of the dishes that we rarely see in the Americanized restaurants that dot the Western suburbs.  Sadly, the taste of the dishes that actually arrived fell well short of what I was expecting.

The pork and napa dumplings might be the biggest disappointment.  Yelp has a review with a picture of six beautifully browned dumplings -- mine did NOT look like that picture.  Three were well browned, two were slightly brown and one was pale white.  I like greasy food but three of them were so covered with oil that I blotted them with napkins before eating them.  The filling was moist but lacked flavor and one was sufficiently undercooked inside that I wouldn't eat it.

The chicken dumplings in Sichuan sauce also failed to impress.  The sauce had big chunks of fresh garlic and it generally had the flavor I was expecting from the dish but had almost no peppery spice to it at all.  The chicken filling was crumbly and dry and generally not appealing.  Overall the dish was more of a reminder of dishes I will travel to eat elsewhere as opposed to something I want to eat.  For those of us stuck in Metro West, Sichuan Gourmet in Framingham  does a credible version of this dish.

The filling in the roast pork buns had no flavor.

The Dan Dan Mien came the closest to the dish I was expecting.  It had sesame; it had spice; and most importantly, it had the pickled vegetable that is so often lacking when the dish is made at Americanized places.  However, I still would have liked a bit more heat and in the end, these noodles were just OK.

I am disappointed to say that the thing Dumpling Daughter does best is to remind me of food that I love but that can be gotten better elsewhere, albeit with a little more travel time.","They were grand open on Jun 6 and we went there for lunch a months after.

As common, most of Chinese restaurants are under staff and below average service.  

Most disappointed us were the dishes we ordered.  It either too greasy or MSG, may be we ordered something not good.

When we saw the dishes came, it looked so tempted and yummy.

Err... First bite, it totally opposite..

Spicy braised beef - Beef wasn't tender and pretty chewy.  The hot pepper probably can covered most of flavor.

Braised pork belly - Super fat pork belly with MSG taste.

Cabbage in clear broth - just a bit salty but ok.

Preserved sweet and sour veggie with fish filet soup - Tasted frozen fish and greasy!!

We did order the chicken, however, we returned to them coz the weird taste.

We probably will not give them 2nd chance!!"
topic2,"['pizza', 'crust', 'cheese', 'topping', 'slice', 'delivery', 'sauce', 'pie', 'thin', 'cold', 'sausage', 'soggy', 'deliver', 'well', 'quality']","Ok we tried Mod pizza tonight for 1st time. We are disappointed. 11 inches for a pizza is small barely enough to feed 2 people and definitely not enough to feed a family. Breadsticks are as flat as cardboard. I mean we know pizza being from Chicago we know good pizza. Toppings were sparce. These pizzas were flatter then thin crust. I don't think we will be eating here again. 11 inch pizza is basically a serving for one person. I mean Papa Murphy's, and Via Chicago even Flying pie has bigger pizzas then Mod Pizza. Even pizza hut or dominos pizzas are bigger then Mod pizza.",Worst Dominos pizza experience I have ever had!!!!!!  I ordered my pizza at 11:19. At 1151 my pizza was out for delivery. I waited a whole hour for my pizza and once it arrived it was cold and I had to reheat my pizza!!!! I would not recommend this place to anyone!! I am encouraging everyone to find a different dominos! This one SUCKS!,"I ordered pizza by the phone call. When I got there the pizza was ready. I gave money, but when I open the box the pizza was burn. They offer me to wait for another pizza and they didn't apologize nor gave discount. I wouldn't recommend this pizza place."
topic3,"['order', 'take', 'wrong', 'delivery', 'come', 'drink', 'minute', 'get', 'item', 'time', 'min', 'half', 'ask', 'receive', 'cold']","Been ordering take outs from this place. Love their vegetarian dishes and fried rice. Ordered from this place several time. BUT Tonight though was BIG FAIL!!!! Order was 2 hours late and we live on Queensborough. One of the dishes we ordered wasn't what we ordered. When called to explain what happened, instead of making it better for the customer, we just got more excuses and owner started to argue. Not happy with the service at all. Won't be ordering from this place again.","Great prices but I think that they are quantity over quality. I order takeout from here occasionally but orders have been inconsistent lately. CHECK YOUR ORDER before leaving because they most likely forgot something or the order is not correct. I order PHO without onions and there is always onions. I order salad roll without ham and there is always ham it them. 

They are very fast at preparing orders but maybe a bit too fast because they seem to usually forget something.",We've ordered twice in about a month. Both times they got our orders wrong. Yesterday's order was not only wrong but it took 1 hr 5 min and we're less than 5 min away. Not ordering from there again.
topic4,"['us', 'table', 'come', 'server', 'waitress', 'ask', 'waiter', 'seat', 'take', 'sit', 'check', 'water', 'bring', 'hostess', 'leave']","If I could give them no stars I would. We came in on a Saturday night and had a reservation which we showed up on time for. We stood at the hostess stand for 15 minutes before anyone came over to greet us and they only came over because a family member of the restaurant was sitting at the bar and felt bad for us. Eventually a waitress came over and said ""are you guys all set?"", ummm no. She seats us at a two top finally and we put our napkins in our lap started looking over the menu and then a different waitress came over to us and told us we had to move because this table was reserved for someone else. There were 4 other tables open and she told us to get up! We left in horror. Terrible service at a restaurant that charges $25+ for pasta. Unreal. You'll probably get better service at McDonald's.","Horrible service... after 20 minutes at the table we had to ask the hostess where our waiter was.  Then we watched all the employees stand around and try and pass us off on each other.  Eventually the ""unluckiest"" came to our table to get us started.  He brought the four items we ordered to the table separately and brought the beer that one person ordered last.  Waiter came back to give us the check without asking if we wanted anything else.  Another beer was ordered, which seemed to be an imposition since the check was already ready.  At the end, he gave us his name and asked us to come back.  I think not....",Several servers continued to walk past our table without greeting us. After I noticed that it wasn't busy I finally had to ask the hostess to see if she could find us a server and sure enough one of the  servers that had looked us over before had to take us. The rest of the servers continued to take tables after us in a timely manner so they simply just didn't want to have to wait on us. Food was good but not worth the terrible service. As a server myself I was disappointed in this overall experience.
topic5,"['burger', 'fry', 'bun', 'onion', 'well', 'patty', 'medium', 'cheese', 'shake', 'cook', 'bacon', 'cold', 'rare', 'ring', 'would']","The service was good but they forgot several items off of the burgers we ordered. My guest and I left feeling quite unsatisfied. We sat at the bar and ordered one well done burger and one medium burger and FB fries. 3 stars on my ordered toppings. Carmelized onions were burnt, didn't ask how I wanted my egg cooked so instead of over medium which is what I assumed they would make, I got one that was well, well done. Feta cheese was sliding off into a drippy mess. I don't mind messy burgers but messy burgers gotta be good. This one didn't make the cut. 3 stars on FB fries. Just okay which is sad because they should be better based on the mixture of ingredients.

What a really great burger needs more than an amazing bun and fresh toppings? A great burger! The meat. The patty. Its gotta be flavorful, juicy, seasoned correctly. This burger was dry. Even the medium burger was dry. My toppings couldn't even enhance the taste. If I had to guess I'd say the lack of seasoning was the issue. I've had really great burgers from specialty burger joints. This place has all the makings to be a great specialty burger place except an actual great burger. 

I did order the chicken pot pie fritters on the snack menu and those were tasty. You get 3 for the for $4. If I ever returned, I'd only order that.","Really rather disappointing, got a burger and fries for takeaway, almost 16 dollars.

burger was meh, fries average. i've tired the burger at the main spot as well, to me very overrated. if i want an overpriced burger i'd go to shake shack, if i wanted a truly great burger i'd make my own, weird every place in town wants to rip off this style.","It was an unfortunately unpleasant experience. While we had dined at Flip Burger establishments in the past and enjoyed ourselves, tonight's excursion was lackluster.
We arrived as walk in guests after catching a movie at the Plaza and were promptly seated. There was confusion over who was responsible for our table and though we placed our orders with one server, two others approached us over time to see whether or not we had ordered. We ordered one shake and three burgers, with modifications only to one (no condiments please). The burgers took an exceptionally long time (30 minutes). When the burgers arrived, the de-condimented burger was loaded with condiments, and the second burger didn't have any of the advertised condiments.
And the shake only arrived after re-requesting it when the burger arrived.

The food tasted fine. My chorizo burger was great, but the complications to the burgers was frustrating.

As a server myself, I often find myself bending over backwards to keep my customers happy. Tonight we were disappointed by our service and food and got little else than a shoulder shrug from our servers. There are tons of other burger places In the city - I'll be sure to try them out before returning to Flip."
topic6,"['wait', 'minute', 'hour', 'long', 'min', 'seat', 'slow', 'line', 'half', 'finally', 'another', 'arrive', 'later', 'come', 'still']","The food was decent, not worth the 20 minute wait, and then another HOUR wait for food.
Overrated, and a waste of time.",Slowest food truck I've ever even heard of.  40 minute wait?!?  Never again.  He was offended that we even brought it up.  Only go here if you care to wait and wait and wait.  And it wasn't even busy.,Worst service. 25 minutes until someone came to get our drink order... And that's after we had to ask the host where our server was. 30 min later Half the food came out. Then we waited another 10 minutes for the other half. Waited another 30 minutes for dessert. Good thing we ordered it the same time as our meal. We were there for 2 hours and 15 minutes. And there were NO apologies from any of the staff for the ridiculous wait. At least most of the food was good.
topic7,"['bar', 'drink', 'beer', 'bartender', 'night', 'friend', 'area', 'sit', 'game', 'music', 'people', 'pretty', 'crowd', 'sport', 'nice']","Roscoe's is your middle-of-the-road bar located in Montavilla. It's neither upscale nor a dive bar, just a comfy dark pub to enjoy good beer, bar food and pool. The tap selection is pretty spectacular and the service is spot-on. I also like that when you start a tab at the bar, they swipe your card and then give it back to you to avoid someone throwing back a few too many walking out without their card and leaving the bar with an unfinished tab. 

This should be a solid 4 star review. However, the experience I recently had when 4 friends and I decided to grab a late-night beer on a quiet Sunday night drops this review down to two stars. On this night, there was another regular patron who was straight up frightening. He was obviously loaded, and not a very nice drunk; playing all the metal music available on the jukebox, throwing his pool cue down like a two-year-old having a temper tantrum, and standing on bar stools over the bar while pulling his pants down around his ankles (thank god he wasn't going commando!) 

The main reason we ended up chugging our beers and high-tailing it out of there is that the bartenders did nothing to quiet, cut-off or kick out this unruly dude. We couldn't quite tell if the bartenders were friends with the guy, or afraid of what might happen if they did try to curb his behavior. I can't imagine being a bartender, bouncer, babysitter and OLCC enforcer all at the same time is an easy feat, but someone really should have stepped in and taken control of the situation. Not many people like a side of crazy with their beer.","We went here on a Saturday night when they had an 80s themed DJ.  They were obviously not used to the crowd of people as they had the chef at the bar making drinks too.  For some reason, they had the seating area closed past the bar and it was so crowded I heard several people leave.  The bartender we got was half pouring drinks, they were very weak and he couldn't find a lime for the drink and said they were out although another bartender was cutting one up shortly after.  So, I thought it was overpriced with bad service, but they were definitely overwhelmed that night.","I'm really surprised to see people call this a dive bar. When I hear 'dive bar', I think someplace like Billy Ray's (which, come to think of it, I love and should review) - an old, no-frills kind of place with beer signs and plumber's butt as the primary decor. This place is relatively large, with a more cool-person feel- arty murals of deer (think more along the lines of the doug fir than deer hunting), retro movies (the warriors) on the tv, and a young, bitchy bartender with dyed black hair. It had no personality.  

We came in about 12:30, and some of the chairs were up. The bartender was talking to her friends at the bar, and gave us a nasty look when we walked in. I asked if they were still open, and she said yes, but not for long. It's a bar, and was listed as being open til bar time, but...ok. We asked how long exactly, since we had friends meeting us. She was like 'UGH, how many people are meeting you?' At that point we felt pretty unwelcome, but figured we'd have the one drink since people were coming, and then go to one of the many other bars in the neighborhood that actually stay open. She was surly about the drinks, hassled me about my temporary license, and went back to standing around talking to her friends. After our friends showed up, along with the 2 other groups there, there were 12 people drinking in the bar. I don't know, it seems like if there are 12 people drinking in your bar on a Tuesday, you might want to stay open. And if not, you could at least try not to make the people feel unwelcome. I would never go back, I wouldn't want to make plans for someplace when I don't know whether it will stay open."

I just want to eat loads of sushi rolls, nigiri, and appetizers to the point where I don't want to eat sushi for another month. Hence, this is the place I go to. Note: It's an AYCE sushi, you can't really expect too high-quality sushi with $30...so don't go in with high expectations.

Décor-wise, I do enjoy the atmosphere of Sushi Junai 2 more--very spacious so you don't have to sit so close to your friends while eating. However, based on my first visit, I'm 80% sure I enjoy the food at Sushi Junai better than the second location. I always order the tuna poke, the mussels, and ex-girlfriend. The tuna poke was not marinated long enough so it was flavorless, the mussels were good, and the ex-girlfriend was covered in sauce. All the sushi rolls I ordered were overwhelmed with sauce and not as appetizing as I remembered at Sushi Junai. The tuna handroll...omg, the sight of it was, honestly, very unenticing. My friend ordered the shrimp udon, which was basically a bowl of sliced vegetables with little noodles and one shrimp.

Again, I can't complain too much because it's an AYCE sushi, but I am disappointed at this location.",horrifying sushi. how can this kind of place be in business? the sushi rolls looked like a 4 year made them. rice was undercooked.. don't go.,"Sushi town is not a place to eat quality sushi. I don't really consider this sushi. They do not really use real quality fish. I enjoy house rolls, but their house rolls are always so warm and so stranger rubbery. I know that most sushi places do not use real crab meat, however, the imitation crab that sushi town uses must come from winco! It's so low-grade and downright gross. Most of the sushi looks unappetizing. I have given this place more chances than I should have. Unfortunately due to the amount of times I have left feeling sick, I don't think I will ever be returning. I truly hope they start using better quality fish and keep their sushi cold! The service is actually usually pretty good though!"

Lack of diversity in dining room also speaks for why its over priced.",nice atmosphere with the comic figurines. tasty food but small portions for the price. I wont be going back because of that. #realfoodforrealpeople,"Went here for Mothers Day lunch on a Saturday afternoon.  

I was a bit surprised to see the restaurant not very busy on such a beautiful sunny day?   

The restaurant had a nice clean environment overall and is great for large groups.  When we arrived, we were greeted and seated immediately.  Our server was great and worth 5 stars.  Where this restaurant lost it's points was the quality of food in the way it was cooked, portion size and price.

Many of us ordered a variety of lunch dishes and found consistencies in cooking.  For example, the fish and chips were quite greasy (likely due to wrong oil temp) and based on the portion for $20, high not worth the price.   Another person who had grilled fish, found theirs a bit dry (essentially over cooked).  This might be why it was not as busy as I would have expected.

Unfortunately I would now definitely cross this particular restaurant off my list as a lunch option (let alone a place to celebrate a special occasion).  It may be better option for dinner, or drinks and appies but there are so many other alternatives that offer so much better value and quality.

I use to be a big fan of the boathouse but unfortunately it has changed to a totally different place from what I use to experience.  Well at least at this location.

The ambiance and table service was great, but the management/owners need to re-evaluate the value and quality of food as well in order to compete for the public's dollar in a congested competitive restaurant industry."

The space is so great, and it's so close to my house, that I wish I could like it - but save for one or two people - interacting with the staff actually makes your day worse, not better. They apparently have forgotten they work in  ""customer service"", where you are supposed to actually serve the customer, not act like you're doing them a favor.  And I should know, I work in customer service.  It isn't always easy, but that's the job.  So, if you don't like it, get another job!  Thanks :)

But the DMV has long lines too - and even they may provide kinder and quicker service than the prickly staff at Belly. 

After visiting Belly several times for breakfast, Ive learned that they operate under a strict set of rules: 

Belly Rule #1: always make way fewer of everything than customers are expecting so  you can consistently disappoint them. For example: make only one or two of every kinda of bagel. That way you can show customers that you are capable of creating something, but will most certainly not be able to deliver.

Belly Rule #2: while we strive to not have enough bagels, sides or toppings, dont tell the customer this when they order. Make sure to tell the customer at the last possible moment that you are out of their food items. This will maximize wait time and inconvenience. 

Belly Rule #3: smiles are not allowed. In fact, try not to look at the customer when they are ordering. our store is very small and we just cant afford to have customers coming back - theres not enough room.

Belly Rule #4: Argue with your co-workers in front of customers. This is mandatory. Lets be honest, you shouldn't even be here today and its totally the bagel prep guy's fault.

Belly Rule #5: improvise. If you see an opportunity to inconvenience, disappoint, or generally turn what could be a wonderful, quaint, delicious little bagel and sandwich shop into a soul-less, rude, bland purveyor of mediocrity, please dont hesitate.",I visited this location at lunch time. The line was very long and the customer service was awful. The restaurant was dirty and no one seemed to care. The owner should probably make some changes before they continue losing customers. I'll never return. Not to mention this location doesn't offer all the items the other locations do.

Sandwich was made incorrectly... asked for light May and onion and received a heavily mayonnaise's sandwich with oil that I didn't ask for. Needless to say my sandwich on wheat was soggy,"I'm a sandwich guy. I live for a good sandwich. I love pork also, with a passion. Their porchetta sandwich was gross, basically it was a pork fat sandwich. I couldn't even eat it. Everyone on here rants and raves about it but me and my girlfriend were both disgusted. It was also expensive for a plain sandwich. Hubbub on Hornbys pork sandwich slays over meat and breads anyday. All I have to say good was the salsa verde had good flavor and the sugar cane cola was tasty. Will not go back for a pork sandwich there ever again. That was my first experience there.","Stopped here today for lunch after having read about it some time ago.  Nice selection of beer both bottled and tap.  Good selection of sandwiches however, the bread used to make them leaves a lot to be desired.  I ordered a pulled pork sandwich, North Carolina style, topped with homemade cole slaw which was supposed to come on a sour dough roll??  The pulled pork was great but the bread could not support nor compliment the sandwich.  It literally turned to mush on the bottom and was inedible.  I did however wolf down the pulled pork which was delicious.  The bread ruined the sandwich.  The same was true for my wife's sandwich which was chicken tips.  Part of the problem could be that the sandwiches are served in a plastic basket lined with a piece of paper that also turns soggy along with the bread.  Too bad.  The menu looked interesting and I would have liked to return and tried more but, as a result, I won't be returning.  A $9.50 sandwich should be made with better bread."

I hate to do this but I have been going to Harry O's for over 20 years now... Loved them! The last 2 times has been hell! They messed up on my price twice. I will not be going there ever again! I would rather go to other places and pay more than go to this place again!!!!,This place still has some kinks to get out. Went last night for dinner. I want to support it but I think I'll wait a few more months to go back. Really hard to be next door to rumis for a similar priced meal at half the level of service. But I'll give it another go.,"I have been going to Exchange Street Bistro since they opened up in Malden.  
Positive:  Great Ambience.  Stylish, clean, modern.
Drinks are great.
Why 2 stars?  Well, this place has a newer chef and the food is just not the same.  For years, I would have given 5 stars because the food was so good.  Having gone a lot of times, I have tried all varieties of food and I used to agree with their advertisement --'back bay experience with neighborhood prices'.  Last two time I went back, I realized how the quality of food has detoriated ,so I am going to stay away from it for a while."
